## Project Overview

Schools, across all levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary), are plagued with a number of issues such as low attendance and lack of feedback/interaction from students. This can have a cascading effect on student performance as outlined below:

- If a student doesn’t attend classes, they are disadvantaged since there will be gaps in their knowledge. This issue compounds itself when the topics that are missed are foundational to more advanced topics.
- Additionally, just because a student attends classes doesn’t mean that they’re understanding the content being delivered by the teacher/lecturer. Students usually do not voice their concerns or otherwise seek help to bridge the gaps in their knowledge. With the lack of feedback from the student body, teachers lose out on the opportunity to bring more value to students.
